APMA 2120 - Fall 2023 and Spring 2024
======
After completing APMA 2120 in the Spring of 2023, I transitioned into a teaching assistant role for the course under Professor Heze Chen in the Fall of 2023, and continued with Professor Chris Hellings in the Spring of 2024.  

So far, I have enjoyed being a TA for this class as it provides the core concepts and serve as must-have preresquite for students to move on to future math class. I took on several responsibilities to support the learning environment:

**Lecture Assistance**: Actively participated in 5+ hours lectures weekly to facilitate discussions and help clarify complex topics for students.  

**Office Hours**: Held 5+ office hours each week to provide one-on-one assistance, ensuring students received support for homework assignments.  

**Worksheet Grading**: Responsible for grading student worksheets, providing constructive feedback to guide their learning process.  

**Exam Review Sessions**: Organized and led review sessions prior to exams, helping students consolidate their knowledge and prepare effectively.
