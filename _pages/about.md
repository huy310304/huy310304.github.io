Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am Huy Nguyen, a second-year student at the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. 

Originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I moved to the U.S. to further my studies as an international student - with a long-term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

I can sleep up to 16 hours on weekends and stay up until 7 AM with classes starting at 9 AM.

> The more you sleep, the higher your GPA.
