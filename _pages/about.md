Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am Huy Nguyen, a second-year student at the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. 

My academic journey is enriched by my involvement in GPU and Computer Architecture research at the Insight Computer Architecture Lab, alongside collaborative projects with professors in the UVA School of Engineering. 

Beyond my coursework and research, I also dedicate myself to academic mentoring by serving as a Teaching Assistant for Applied Mathematics courses and a Mentor for CORE Scholar Program. 

In my free time, I enjoy camping on the library taking online courses about Computer Science topics and working on my personal projects.

Originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I moved to the U.S. to further my studies as an international student - with a long-term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

Fun Fact: I can sleep up to 16 hours on weekends and stay up until 7 AM with classes starting at 9 AM.

> The more you sleep, the higher your GPA ðŸ˜ª.
