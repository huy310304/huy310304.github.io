<p>As a Teaching Assistant, I love helping students learn and grow. I believe education can change lives and I enjoy making learning fun and interesting 🎉. My job is to support students, answer their questions, and help them understand tough concepts.</p>

<p>For me, it's not just about teaching stuff; it's about encouraging students to be curious 🧐 and confident 💪 and making them feel comfortable and excited 😊 about learning.</p>

<p>Below are the courses I have been a Teaching Assistant for. Please click on the links for more detailed information:</p>

<blockquote>I want students to be successful, and that's why I give them full credits on their homework when grading.</blockquote> 🎁😄
