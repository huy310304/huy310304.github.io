As a Teaching Assistant, I love helping students learn and grow 🌱. I believe education can change lives and I enjoy making learning fun and interesting 🎉. My job is to support students, answer their questions, and help them understand tough concepts.

For me, it's not just about teaching stuff; it's about encouraging students to be curious 🧐 and confident 💪 and making them feel comfortable and excited 😊 about learning.

Below are the courses I have been a Teaching Assistant for. Please click on the links 🔗 for more detailed information:
